                The Hidden Isle is a pen and paper RPG that uses Tarot cards instead of dice. The game is set in an alternative 16th century on the island of Dioscoria: a secret port of magicians, adventurers and free thinkers. The game focuses on roleplaying and collaborative storytelling, and has mechanics to explore character growth. <br><br>
                Guided by the Seer (the game master), players use Tarot cards to test their skills during battles and challenges, but also to construct their character’s story: cards determine the emotional burden they carry and the ideal they strive for.
                <br><br>
                As agents of Dioscoria, players head out into the world to defend the island’s values: protecting the helpless and preserving knowledge. Campaigns themselves can be drawn up with Tarot cards, creating sprawling adventures with little preparation and many surprises for everyone at the table.

                  <h2>Narrative Heavy, Rules Light: </h2> While the game does have rules, their purpose is to enrich and drive your narratives. The game is designed as a collaborative storytelling experience.
                  <br><br>
                  <h2>Play and character growth intertwined:</h2> Each character has a burden—an emotional weight they carry—and an ideal to live up to. Become your truest self, or succumb to your worst impulses.
                  <br><br>
                  <h2>A vibrant 16th-century world:</h2> Dioscoria is described in loving detail, as are major cities of the time such as London, Istanbul and Venice. No historical knowledge is needed.
                  <br><br>
                  <h2>A wide array of characters:</h2> Play as an Illusionist, Scoundrel, Occultist, Prowler, Champion or Hunter. More characters are planned for stretch goals.
                  <br><br>
                  <h2>Tarot cards instead of dice:</h2> They’re used for everything from scenario inspiration, to character backstories, to divination, to skill checks. No Tarot experience is required. Any deck can be used, but we recommend the Sefirot deck.
